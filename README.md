This is a simple [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) that can come in handy if you want to improve your productivity.

<h2><b> How does this work? </b></h2>
<p> When you start the pomodoro, your terminal will display the message "Pomodoro started", meaning that your pomodoro has just started.
<p> After 25 minutes have passed, a new terminal window will be open to show the message "rest", so it's time for a break. It lasts 5 minutes.
<p> Once the rest time is over, another terminal window will be open telling you it's "Time to work", and another session of 25 minutes of work will be started.
<p> This process will be repeated 4 times, but the last break will last 30 minutes.
<p> After the last and longest break, you will be asked whether you want to start a new pomodoro session.

<h2><b> How to use it </b></h2>
<p> To run this program you need Python 3.5.3 version or higher, then simply go into the directory where it's being stored in your computer and enter this in your terminal:

	$ python pomodoro.py

<p> Note that this should only work if you have some version of Python installed. Look for the instructions for doing so on https://www.python.org/.
<p> Do not put the files in different directories in order to ensure pomodoro.py works fine.
<p><b> This version of the program runs on Windows, MACOSX and Debian derivate distros. </b>
